Translates numbers to words

I did this so that each part of the project had separate responsibilities

To run the application, open the solution with Visual Studio and click start.

The web page makes some basic validation to make sure the entries are numbers that can be translated

The way the project logic work is by “Translating” each digit from left to right, and then removing that number and translating the rest.
